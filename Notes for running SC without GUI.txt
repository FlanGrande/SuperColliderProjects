Launch server:
.\scsynth.exe -u 57110

Help:
.\scsynth.exe -h




THIS WORKS:
.\sclang.exe

When this runs, it reads and executes the code written in: C:\Users\djfer\AppData\Local\SuperCollider\startup.scd
Using Server.waitForBoot({function}) we can load the OSC receivers and several SynthDefs.


TO DO:
 - Run sclang.exe from Godot.
 - Check if we can run sclang.exe and scsynth.exe without installing SuperCollider.
	Likely to not work, and even if it does, there's no SuperCollider folder on AppData.
 - If that doesn't work, check if we can install SC using Inno.
 - Export SnakeClon and try to see if it works.
 - Figure out how to use user folder and AppData files if necessary.
	We need to install the startup.scd file into AppData, but for that we need to install SC...
